        <h2>Sophmore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a sophmore at Bob Jones University studying Business with a focus in Marketing. I work for the Wilds Christian Camp during the summer.</p>
         <p>
            I love to meet and connect with people as I am a member of the university's Entrepreneurial Network (E-NET). I enjoy ministering to teenagers at camp, and I love sports.  I want to one day use sports as a Christian ministry to share the Gospel.  
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy running, basketball, and spikeball.
